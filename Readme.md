### Dataset
**Ford GoBike System Data**
\
Data consists of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.

### Main findings from the exploratory data analysis
- Most trips take less than 20 minutes.
- Just 0.77% of the trips are of duration more than an hour. These data points may be outliers.
- The number of trips is the minimum on Saturday and Sunday compared to other days. These days are the weekends. I think this because the number of trips increases on the workdays.
- Most of the trips are from 8 am - 9 am and 5 pm - 6 pm. This may be related to the time when people go to work or school and when they leave.
- 76.18 % of users are male whereas, 23.82% of users are females.
- 9.41 % of users are Customers whereas, 90.59 % of users are subscribers.
- The age distribution is right-skewed.
- Most of the users are 20 to 45 years, and people of this age work or study. This distribution is consistent with the distribution of weekdays. Both say people who work or study ride more bikes.
- The median duration doesn't differ so much between hours.
- The trips duration on Saturday and Sunday is longer than the other days. People on weekends use bikes for fun and entertainment.
- The relationship between members' age and trips duration is negative.
- Females go on trips longer than males but by a small difference.
- Subscribers go on trips less on time than customers go. Most subscribers go on less than 10-minute trips.
- Most of People who ride bikes at 8 am - 9 am or 5 pm-6 pm are subscribers. These times when people go to work or study.
- From this graph, we can be sure that people who go to work or study are subscribers. On the weekdays, the number of subscribers is greater than on the weekends.
- On all days, customers go on longer trips than subscribers, especially at midnight and midday.
- The trip duration increases for customers on the weekends, but for subscribers, it is consistent during all days.
- Females go on long-duration trips than males, no matter they are subscribers or customers.
- From the graph, we got a reason for why females go on longer duration trips than males. Females are younger than males, and the relationship between duration and ages is negative.

### How you chose the results to put in your explanatory analysis.
I choose the result that will help me get a good conclusion about the duration of the trip.
You will find that the age of members is the feature that influences the duration trip the most. The number of females is less than the number of males, but we found that females go on long-duration trips than males. And this is because females are younger than males. No matter they are customers or subscribers. In all cases, females go on longer duration trips than males because of their young age.
